# Materials for a workshop on getting started with practical Haskell

**TL;DR Get up to speed *fast* with Haskell so you can use it for everyday tasks.**

We intend to present a workshop to interested software developers who 

* already know a language like Python, Ruby, Java, C, Clojure
* are possibly from a systems background, or similar.

We're targetting people who want to start using the language immediately, without wading through piles of documentation or spending weeks learning theory.

We want Haskell to be seen as a candidate for the kind of tasks you might write a quick Bash, Python or Ruby script for. But also as a language which can scale, both perfomance-wise and in terms of software. It's a fast language, but also a flexible, well-engineered language with an advanced type system. You won't pay a maintenance penalty for Haskell code, and won't have to later rewrite in C for performance reasons.

The workhop is intended to be

* Self directed
* Cookbook style rather than lecture or tutorial style

Along the lines of [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/) (but updated and incorporating newer libraries)
but also incorporating the ideas of [How to read Haskell like Python](http://blog.ezyang.com/2011/11/how-to-read-haskell/).
